I developed an interactive game using PyGame and Deep Q-Learning (DQL). While the agent I created controlled the character in real time, I visualized the neural network performance with OpenCV by applying Neural Network Visualization. I highlighted strong connections in red, weak connections in blue, and the active action in green. In this way, I was able to observe the performance of the model I created. It consists of 2 layers of 24 and 12 neurons for 2 inputs and 3 actions: go left, go right and stop.
